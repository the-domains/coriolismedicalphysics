            <description><![CDATA[<p>As a traveling physicist I have the opportunity to work with a variety of equipment that has been purchased for various reasons by other physicists over the years. There’s really two technology choices that impact the daily life of a physicist and both are expensive enough that we rarely get to make them in our career and even more rarely will have had experience with the different choices in anything other than a demonstration by the vendor. So to help with optimizing these choices I thought I’d publish my opinion, which I’ll state is only one physicist’s opinion, and no, I do not have a financial interest in this besides helping others get the best bang for the buck.</p>]]></description>
